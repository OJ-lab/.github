### 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction

OnlineJudge(OJ) is an interesting thing, for most of us, it get birth from algorithm practice use.
Although OJ is already not a so popular topic nowadays, but we still can't live without it.

OJ lab is an oganization which aims to build stable/flex/interest OnlineJudge tools & applications.
We start very slow recently, but we have some demo on Ex. a *unix Judger, a webgl game(in case you get bored when studying😂).
More than we already got, some more topics like cloud native, new judge form Etc. are considered.

We hope OJ lab can be a place which can create unlimit possiblity for you.

### 🌈 Contribution guidelines

We mainly rely abilities provided by **Github**(Ex. actions, discuss, projects) to get us connected.
But we may also use some tools like **Figma** for website designing, or **Discord** for public communicating(If we get enough fans).

To join in this oganization, you may need to contribute some PR or Issues to help us getting know with you, then we will invite you in an appropriate time🎉.
